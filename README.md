# Seismic-well tie

In this notebook you will find a way to read .las files, like the ANP (Petroleum Agency of Brazil) well logs, create a time-depth table and plot the results.

It is necessary to have the data to run the code. If you don't have any ANP data you can use any .las file. 

If you would like to improve this codes, please, let me know! :)
